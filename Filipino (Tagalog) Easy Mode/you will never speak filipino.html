<p>First of all, THERE ARE NO VERBS IN FILIPINO!!!</p>
<p>C'est-à-dire, there is not a set of words in the category of « verbs ». <br>
Although, there are thousands of indefinite pronouns (someone, something, someplace, sometime, somehow…).</p>
<p>But how could it be possible that a language has no verbs?</p>
<p>There are verbs, of course. It's just that it's not a set of words; but a function.</p>
<p>Take for example « basketball ». What does one do with basketball? <br>
Ride? <br>
Listen? <br>
Cook? <br>
Of course not, you silly! <br>
YOU PLAY BASKETBALL!</p>
<p>How about shoes? <br>
Drink? Write? Sing? <br>
NO! YOU WEAR IT!</p>
<p>In Filipino, one would say "Nagbabasketball ako" → "I'm basketballing", "Nagsapatos ako" → "I shoesed".</p>
<p>Now, the language, Filipino. I don't know — maybe it's edible or something. <br>
Because in Filipino, it is not possible that "I speak Filipino" but possible that "I Filipino".</p>
<p>tldr; In Filipino, there is not word for speaking a language.</p>
<p>P.S. It is a common mistake to translate « speak » with « salita ». Salita means to talk or say something, not to speak a language.</p>
