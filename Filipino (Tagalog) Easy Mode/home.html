<p>Congratulations! You already have attained more than 50% progress in learning Tagalog just by knowing English as Filipino can be spoken with nouns, verbs and adjectives in all English – and some adverbs and disjuctions as well.</p>
<p>This course will teach Tagalog using English vocabulary in Tagalog grammar. Basically the bare minimum Filipino which could be still considered Filipino. <br>
From here, one could start learning without having the lack of vocabulary as a stumbling block.</p>
<p>Although, please use the opportunity to learn vocabulary bit by bit while learning the grammar</p>
<p>Now onto the non-negotiables</p>
