<h1>Important note on the Future Tense</h1>
<p>Tagalog is a very future sensitive language meaning<br>
    <b>THE FUTURE TENSE CANNOT BE REPLACED BY THE PRESENT TENSE!!!</b><br>
    Written in bold caps as it is a very important point in Tagalog. It's not like in English that when I am about to go, I can say "I'm going". When something is not happening yet it must be in the future tense. Thus, it should be "I will go". This is very important to know before going onto the next lessons.</p>
<h1>There are only three <s>tenses</s></h1>
<p>Actually they are called "aspects" linguistically in the case of Tagalog.<br>
An action could be finished, ongoing or will happen in the future. Although, the difference is that aspects is based on the temporal setting - not the present.</p>
<p>For example, "Yesterday, it was raining". The temporal setting here is yesterday. Even though yesterday belongs in the past, as our temporal setting here is yesterday and the rain is ongoing on that period, one must use the present aspect. In Tagalog it will be "Yesterday, it is raining".</p>
