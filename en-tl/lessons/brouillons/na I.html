<p><h1>Na</h1>
Not not the EpiCon « na » but SPAM.</p>
<p><h3>What is to come is already come</h3></p>
<p>It's 9 in the evening. You are with your friends and you declare "I'm hungry".<br>
Well, it's 9 in the evening and you haven't eaten yet. Is one not supposed to get hungry with the passing of time?</p>
<h4>What is bound to happen already happened.</h4>
<p>Directly translating will result to "Gutom ako." but that would be completely wrong. In this situation, "na" should be used.</p>
<h3>Gutóm na ako</h3>

<p>You've been playing badminton with your friends for three hours. Tiring, yes. Thus you declare, "I'm tired."<br>
Isn't it expected that one gets tired after a long period of play?</p>
<h4>What is supposed to happen already happened.</h4>
<p>Direct translation would give, "Pagod ako." but of course, "na" is to be used.</p>
<h3>Pagód na ako</h3>

<p>You're friend Johnny will be late to the party, he has things to do at work.<br>
    "Go ahead", he said, "I'll catch up."</p>
<p>You've started the party without Johnny. 45 minutes pass, enters the man. "I'm here", he declares.</p>
<h4>Who is expected to come is already come.</h4>
<p>Direct translation would give, "Nanditō 'ko." but like really? You're there? We've been expecting you.</p>
<h3>Nandito na ako</h3>
<hr>
<p>A friend invited you for dinner. The dinner was delicious and very filling. Friend asked if you would like another serving.</p>
<p>"Thank you but I'm already full."</p>
<h4>What is meant to happen has already happened.</h4>
<h3>Hindí¡ na. Busóg na ako.</h3>
