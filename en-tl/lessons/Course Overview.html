<h3>Filipino is a three lexica language</h3>
<p>Don't be surprised to find english and also spanish words when learning and even when using it in practice.</p>
<p>In fact, we discourage trying to use local tagalog words too much. Natives won't spreak like that like <strong>AT ALL</strong>. We even encourage questioning your teacher if you have not heard any english words during the instruction as it will not be conducive to learning the language that the natives speak.</p>
<p><strong>ACCEPT THAT FILIPINOS WILL USE FOREIGN WORDS DURING THEIR DISCOURSE.</strong></p>
<p>This is the same situation as in English. English consists of words of French, German and local origin sometimes other borrowed foreign words.</p>
<p>Avoiding the French, German and other foreign lexicon words in favour of local words does not make better English. It just sounds weird. And a lot of times those words don't even exist.</p>
<p>For some reason, unfortunately, a lot of native Filipino speakers have not yet internalised this fact. Even academics.</p>
