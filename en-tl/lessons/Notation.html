<h1>Notation</h1>
<h2>!!! Outside of linguistic study Tagalog does not use accent marks !!!</h3>
<p><h3>I. All single syllable words are not stressed.</h3>
Except when the conditions of number III or VI are met.</p>
<p><h3>II. By default, words in Tagalog has a long penultimate syllable.</h3>
But some words (a lot actually) have none. To denote that there is no stress on the penultimate syllable, the final syllable will be notated with a vowel with a left accent [á, é, í, ó, ú]</p>
<p>Non-default long syllables will be notated with a vowel with a long accent [ā, ē, ī, ō, ū]<br>
Long penultimate syllables wouldn't be marked as they are the default.<br></p>
Suffixed words on which the default stress is the third final syllable will not be marked either.
<p><h3>III. The glottal stop</h3>
The glottal stop symbol looks like this <strong>ʔ</strong> but due to it not being available on the keyboard, we will type it as ¡ and maybe replace it later with the glottal stop symbol. You will see ¡ a lot.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The glottal stop can only occur at the end of a word</li>
    <li>If the word that ends in a glottal stop is immediately followed by any word within a cadence or the flow of speech, the glottal stop dissolves and lengthens the syllablethat contains it.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>IIII. Elisive iy and uw</h3>
There iy and uw successions in some word that are not supposed to be considered for separate syllables. These are just remnants of old spelling but cannot be restandandardised as they have already been in the language for long. Most words containing these have already been simplified to just « y » or « w » except for the really fundamental ones. In these cases, we will use the right accent [à, è, ì, ò, ù] to indicate that they are not to be pronounced.<br>
Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>hùwag - don't - pronounced [wag] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>duwág - coward - pronounced [du-wág] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>sìya - he / she - pronounced [sha] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>biyás - stock bones for soup - pronounced [bi-yás] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>nìya - his / her - pronounced [nya] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>hiyáʔ - shame - pronounce [hi-yáʔ] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>ìyan - that one - pronounced [yan] (close to the second person) (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>iyák - cry - pronounced [i-yák] (two syllables)</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>V. Variable ng</h3>
    Certain conjugations and constructions in which a word or an affix ends in « ng » can have variable spelling - sometimes even obligatory.<br>
    ng → n before [d, l, s, t]; ng → m before [b, p].<br>
    Although, all « ng » can vary in pronunciation depending on the letter that proceeds it, just not the spelling.</p>
    Examples:
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>Certain fixed expessions
                    <li>sangaŋg daán → sangaŋdaán - crossroad</li>
                    <li>bagoŋg bayan → baguɱbayan - new town (common place name)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul>Epicon for numbers
                    <li>dalawáŋg pu¡ → dalawaɱpú¡ - </li>
                    <li>limáŋg daán → limáŋdaán - five hundred</li>
                    <li>tatlóŋg libo → tatlúŋlibo - three thousand</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <ul>for intended use of
                <li>
                    <li>paŋglalaki → paŋlalaki - for males</li>
                    <li>paŋgbabae → paɱbabae - for females</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <il>estar construction
                <li>
                    <li>aŋg baho¡ → aɱbaho¡ - what stench!</li>
                    <li>aŋg tangá → aŋtangá - how stupid!</li>
                </li>
            </il>
        </ul>
    We shall write it as [ŋg, ŋ, ɱ] to indicate that the default spelling is « ng » and is variable.<br>
    Due to the characters' unavailability in the keyboard, we might write it as [ńg, ń, ḿ].
</p>
<p><h3>VI. Coalescing ng</h3>
    <a href="../grammar/Rules of Prefixation.html">Go to this lesson</a><br>
    This will also be notated with [ŋg, ŋ, ɱ] or [ńg, ń, ḿ].
</p>
<p><h3>VII. Special pronunciation property of the word "akó"</h3>
    <a href="Pronunciation of akó.html">Go to this lesson</a><br>
    This will not have a special notation and will be spelt as is.
</p>.
<h4>All these are not standard notation as there is no standard notation anyway.</h4>
