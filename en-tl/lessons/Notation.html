<h1>Notation</h1>
<h2>!!! Outside of linguistic study Tagalog does not use accent marks !!!</h3>
<p><h3>I. All single syllable words are not stressed.</h3>
Except when the conditions of number III are met.</p>
<p><h3>II. By default, words in Tagalog has a long penultimate syllable.</h3>
To denote that there is no stress on the penultimate syllable, the final syllable will be notated with a vowel with a left accent [áéíóú]</p>
<p>Long syllables will be notated with a vowel with a long accent [āēīōū]<br>
Long penultimate syllables wouldn't be marked as they are the default.</p>
<p><h3>III. The glottal stop</h3>
The glottal stop symbol looks like this <strong>ʔ</strong> but due to it not being available on the keyboard, we will type it as ¡ and replace it later with the glottal stop symbol. You might see ¡ from time to time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The glottal stop can only occur at the end of a word</li>
    <li>If the word that ends in a glottal stop is immediately followed bt any word within a cadence or the flow of speech, the glottal stop dissolves and lengthens the last syllable of the former.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>IIII. Elisive iy and uw</h3>
There iy and uw successions in some word that are not supposed to be considered for separate syllables. These are just remnants of old spelling but cannot be restandanardised as they have already been in the language for long. Most words containing these have already been simplified to just « y » or « w » except the really fundamental ones. In these cases, we will use the right accent to indicate that they are not to be pronounced.<br>
Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>hùwag - don't - pronounced [HWAG or WAG] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>duwág - coward - pronounced [du-WAG] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>sìya - he / she - pronounced [SHA] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>biyás - stock bones for soup - pronounced [bi-YAS] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>níya - his / her - pronounced [NYA] (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>hiyáʔ - shame - pronounce [hi-YAʔ] (two syllables)</li>
    <li>ìyan - that one - pronounced [YAN] (close to the second person) (just one syllable)</li>
    <li>iyák - cry - pronounced [i-YAK] (two syllables)</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>V. Variable ng</h3>
    Certain conjugations and constructions in which a word or an affix ends in « ng » can have variable spelling - sometimes even obligatory.<br>
    ng → n before [d, l, s, t]; ng → m before [b, p].<br>
    Although, all « ng » can vary in pronunciation depending on the letter that proceeds it, just not the spelling.</p>
    Examples:
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>Certain fixed expessions
                    <li>sangang daán → sangańdaán - crossroad</li>
                    <li>bagong bayan → baguḿbayan - new town (common place name)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul>Epicon for numbers
                    <li>dalawáng pu¡ → dalawaḿpú¡ - </li>
                    <li>limáng daán → limáńdaán - five hundred</li>
                    <li>tatlóńg libo → tatlúńlibo - three thousand</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <ul>for intended use of
                <li>
                    <li>pańglalaki → pańlalaki - for males</li>
                    <li>pańgbabae → paḿbabae - for females</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <il>estar construction
                <li>
                    <li>ańg baho¡ → aḿbaho¡ - what stench!</li>
                    <li>ańg tangá → ańtangá - how stupid!</li>
                </li>
            </il>
        </ul>
    We shall write it as [ńg, ń, ḿ] to indicate that the default spelling is « ng » and is variable.
    </p>
